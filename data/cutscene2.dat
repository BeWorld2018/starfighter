FACE_SID
We're nearly ready to make the jump to Eyananth.
FACE_CHRIS
Aren't there a lot of WEAPCO slaves in this system?
FACE_SID
Correct. It's got one of the highest mortality rates in the galaxy.
FACE_CHRIS
Well, that's no good! We'll have to do something about that, then.
FACE_SID
Just remember that we won't be in Spirit anymore and you may run into WEAPCO patrols while travelling.
FACE_CHRIS
We may actually be able to use that to our advantage. You thinking what I'm thinking?
FACE_SID
I sure am. I'll come up with a plan of action.
