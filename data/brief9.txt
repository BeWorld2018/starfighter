I need some resources before we leave, it'll make life a lot easier in Mordor. Problem is that the parts are hoarded by WEAPCO.

Where can we get the parts, then?
FACE_SID
There's a big shipment of them nearby. I can disable the supply craft carrying them; I just need you to give me some cover while I do it.
FACE_CHRIS
You got it!
