In order to create the final soundtrack, you need the following packages
installed:

- csound
- abcmidi
- fluid-soundfont-gm
- vorbis-tools

The .abc files contain the music scores in ABC notation. These are converted to
MIDI format with abc2midi.  For each .abc file there is a .csd file which sets
up the instruments so csound can render the MIDI file. At the moment we are
using only the fluid opcodes. These render notes using a General Midi
soundfont.  After csound has rendered everything to a .wav file, oggenc is used
to create the final .ogg file.

If the abcm2ps package is installed, you can create sheet music from the .abc files.
This can be helpful to spot mistakes.

TODO:

- Use ABC part notation to simulate module tracker patterns.
- Use csound to add effects that cannot be represented by ABC (for example, filter sweeps).
